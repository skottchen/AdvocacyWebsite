          Dear Maryland State Representatives, <br />
          We, residents of Maryland, are concerned about the digital literacy
          gap in our communities and in the United States. Our digital literacy
          skills are essential for our ability to participate in society and
          succeed in our communities. Data shows that digital literacy gaps are
          increasing in areas such as education, healthcare, and employment. To
          combat this gap, we are seeking to raise awareness about the digital
          literacy gap and promote educational tools and resources that can help
          us navigate the digital world. We, the undersigned, call on
          representatives of the Maryland State Legislature to make a difference
          by increasing funding for digital literacy education programs in
          Maryland K-12 schools. Please support us by signing our petition and
          spreading awareness about the digital literacy gap in our communities.
